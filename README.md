My third attempt on trying to evolve the QR-Code-Generator App after my liking. While using the gained knowledge from the Udemy course: "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" mixed with the following along of the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kawVrK4v7Os.

The App should be able to take in three fundamental information of a person. The name, the family name, and the phone number and turn it into a QR-Code so it can be scanned for instance at a restaurant or a cafe.

Successful changes:

-The user information will be saved as soon as you press on generate. Next time you open the app it's ready         
-Better keyboard management. The keyboard hides after any tap on the screen outside of the textfields         
-The UI of the app has improved         
-Whitespaces will be detected and disable the "generate" button         
-At least 2 letters for names required and 7 digits for the phone number or the "generate" button stays disabled      


NEXT STEPS:

-Make the QR-Code look more "sharp"       
-Phone number textfield won't allow pasting in anything else than numbers     
-Work more on the auto layout     

-If possible add an option that includes your generated QR-Code to the Apple Wallet (maybe with PassKit)
